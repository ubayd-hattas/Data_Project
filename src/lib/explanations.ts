  unemployment:
    'South Africa has one of the highest unemployment rates globally among major economies. The official rate excludes "discouraged workers" — people who have given up searching — so the expanded rate typically runs 8–10 percentage points higher. The quarterly QLFS is the definitive source but is released with a 6–8 week lag.',
  inflation:
    'The SARB targets CPI within a 3–6% band. Readings persistently above 6% typically trigger interest rate hikes. Food and transport make up over 30% of the basket and disproportionately affect lower-income households, whose effective inflation rate often differs from the headline figure.',
  crime:
    'Crime statistics are released annually by SAPS for April–March financial years. Under-reporting is a significant factor, particularly for sexual offences and domestic violence. Murder rate is considered the most reliable indicator as it is hardest to misclassify. South Africa\'s rates remain far above global averages.',
  education:
    'The matric pass rate measures students who achieved 30%+ in all subjects — a relatively low bar. Quality is better assessed via Bachelor\'s-pass rates (needed for university entry) or international literacy/numeracy benchmarks such as PIRLS and TIMSS, where SA consistently underperforms.',
  population:
    'Population figures derive primarily from the 2022 National Census, the first since 2011. Mid-year estimates are produced annually by Stats SA using demographic modelling. The 2022 census recorded significant undercounting challenges and results should be treated as estimates with margin of error.',
  housing:
    'Housing data comes from the 2022 Census and General Household Survey. "Formal dwelling" definitions can mask quality — a brick house without running water counts as formal. Stats SA distinguishes between piped water in dwelling, on site, and nearby, which significantly affects access rates.',
  gdp:
    'South Africa\'s GDP figures follow international SNA 2008 standards. The quarterly national accounts are released about 10 weeks after quarter end. GDP per capita has been broadly stagnant since 2013 as population growth has largely offset economic expansion. Mining and manufacturing cyclicality drives significant quarter-to-quarter volatility.',
  census:
    'The 2022 Census was South Africa\'s first since 2011 — an 11-year gap compared to the usual 5–10 years. Stats SA acknowledged undercounting of approximately 1–2 million people. Census data forms the baseline for all population-derived statistics and government planning.',

  unemployment: (stat) =>
    `High unemployment in South Africa drives inequality, poverty, and social instability. At ${stat.value}, roughly ${Math.round(stat.rawValue * 0.275)}% of the working-age population is excluded from formal economic participation. Youth unemployment is especially critical as prolonged joblessness early in a career has lasting effects on lifetime earnings and social mobility.`,
  inflation: (stat) =>
    `Inflation at ${stat.value} directly affects the purchasing power of every South African. The SARB targets 3–6%; readings outside that band influence interest rate decisions, which in turn affect mortgage repayments, business investment, and the rand. Food inflation is the component most felt by low-income households.`,
  crime: (stat) =>
    `Crime has significant economic and social costs in South Africa — it deters foreign investment, suppresses tourism, and forces households and businesses to spend heavily on private security. ${stat.title} at ${stat.value} reflects one of the most visible quality-of-life indicators in the country.`,
  education: (stat) =>
    `Education outcomes shape the long-run labour supply and are central to reducing structural unemployment. The matric pass rate at ${stat.value} represents the gateway to tertiary education and formal employment. Sustained improvement in educational quality is widely cited as the most important long-term lever for reducing inequality.`,
  population: (stat) =>
    `South Africa\'s population of ${stat.value} determines planning requirements for housing, healthcare, education, and social grants. Population growth and urbanisation patterns directly inform infrastructure investment priorities at national and provincial level.`,
  housing: (stat) =>
    `Access to formal housing and basic services is a core development indicator. At ${stat.value}, this metric reflects both historical delivery progress and the ongoing backlog. Housing access correlates strongly with health outcomes, educational attainment, and economic participation.`,
  gdp: (stat) =>
    `GDP growth at ${stat.value} is the primary measure of economic expansion. South Africa needs sustained growth of 5%+ to meaningfully reduce unemployment and expand the tax base for social spending. Structural constraints — energy, logistics, regulatory complexity — have kept growth well below that threshold since 2012.`,
  census: (stat) =>
    `Census data underpins all government planning and resource allocation. The 2022 Census is the definitive source for population, household composition, and service access data. ${stat.title} at ${stat.value} reflects the outcome of the most comprehensive survey of South African society.`,
